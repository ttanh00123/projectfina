I was so bored at Changi one day I started scrolling Google Play  for some apps that might help me cope with life in Singapore as a scholar, which means financial independence and all, so first thing that comes to mind is a finance app. One small issue - those that I found is a pure hassle to use. You had to manually type in your transactions, the notifications are scarce, and most of the time I would just end up losing all the discipline and fall back into a spending spiral and end up eating noodles until the next cash out day. FinA aims to resolve this. The app utilises the parsing power of an LLM model (LLaMa 3.2 3B) to extract information out of sheer simple chats such as "i bought a kopi for 3.5 dollars", keeping the process simple and clean for users. Further developments include building an agentic AI to give users a summary about their monthly spendings and advices to keep the budgetting clean, as well as to notify them when their budget is soon reaching the cap.
